# ASIK4
# A brief explanation
### Observer Pattern
- A behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- Benefits: Loose coupling, reusability, testability. 

### Factory Pattern
- A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Benefits: Encapsulation, flexibility, maintainability.
